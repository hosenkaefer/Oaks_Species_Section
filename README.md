For my research module in bioinformatics. 
There are 28 different oak species (Quercus spp.), which can be divided into three sections (Cerris, Lobatae and Quercus). 
I would like to sample three randomly selected oak species from each section.

In the first column of the excel table, the oak species are listed under the header "Quercus". 
In the second column, the corresponding section is listed under the header "Sektion".
